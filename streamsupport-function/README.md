This folder contains a set of utilities that are able to extract the package `java8.util.function` out of the **[net.sourceforge.streamsupport:streamsupport][streamsupport-link]** library and package to be java 5 compatible under the group id/name `ro.derbederos.hamcrest:streamsupport-function`.
This is, at the moment, experimental work.
